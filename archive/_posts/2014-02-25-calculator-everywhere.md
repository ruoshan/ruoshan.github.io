Here are some handy ways to do my math:

- in a Terminal, I could `alias ca='printf "%d\n"'`, then just type `ca 3*12-32` to
  get myself the result, but remember not to have spaces.
- in Vim, under insert-mode, I could use the `<c-r>=3*12-32` to directly insert
  the result.
- Not to mention the Interpreter of many language, like Python and Ruby.
